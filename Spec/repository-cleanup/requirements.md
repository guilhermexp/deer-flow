# Requirements: Repository Cleanup

## Introduction

This feature aims to clean up the repository by removing obsolete files, duplicate configurations, temporary files, and unnecessary artifacts that accumulate during development. The goal is to improve repository hygiene, reduce confusion, and maintain a clean project structure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove obsolete screenshot directories so that the repository is cleaner and easier to navigate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing screenshot directories THEN the system SHALL identify all screenshot directories (screenshots*, screenshots-crud-test)
2. WHEN identifying screenshots THEN the system SHALL categorize them by purpose (testing vs documentation)
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL preserve only the most recent/complete set of screenshots
4. WHEN removing screenshots THEN the system SHALL ensure at least one complete test suite documentation remains

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to consolidate environment configuration files so that there is no confusion about which configuration to use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for .env files THEN the system SHALL identify all .env* files in the repository
2. WHEN analyzing .env files THEN the system SHALL detect duplicate configurations between root and web directories
3. WHEN consolidating THEN the system SHALL keep only one .env.example file in the project root
4. WHEN consolidating THEN the system SHALL maintain separate .env files for different environments (development, production)
5. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL document the environment file structure in the README

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove temporary and debug files so that the repository contains only production-ready artifacts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for temporary files THEN the system SHALL identify all .log, .tmp, debug-chat-output.txt files
2. WHEN identifying temporary files THEN the system SHALL check if they contain important debugging information
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove backend.log and debug-chat-output.txt unless they contain critical information
4. WHEN scanning mock data THEN the system SHALL evaluate if mock and replay files in ./web/public/ are still needed for development

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to clean up obsolete Spec documents so that only active and relevant specifications remain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing Spec directory THEN the system SHALL identify completed or abandoned spec projects
2. WHEN analyzing specs THEN the system SHALL identify which ones are marked as "complete" or have outdated dates
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL archive or remove specs that are no longer relevant
4. WHEN preserving specs THEN the system SHALL keep only the most recent version of related specifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to remove cache and temporary build artifacts so that the repository remains lightweight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning for cache files THEN the system SHALL identify .coverage, __pycache__, and other cache directories
2. WHEN identifying build artifacts THEN the system SHALL check for .next, dist, build directories
3. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove all Python __pycache__ directories
4. WHEN cleaning up THEN the system SHALL remove .coverage file
5. WHEN preserving THEN the system SHALL keep .gitignore entries that prevent these files from being committed

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to document the cleanup process so that team members understand what was removed and why.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing cleanup THEN the system SHALL document all files and directories removed
2. WHEN documenting THEN the system SHALL provide reasons for each removal decision
3. WHEN completing cleanup THEN the system SHALL create a summary report of changes made
4. WHEN documenting THEN the system SHALL update the project README with cleanup guidelines for future development

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to verify the cleanup doesn't break functionality so that the application remains fully operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. BEFORE cleanup THEN the system SHALL create a comprehensive backup plan
2. AFTER cleanup THEN the system SHALL verify the application still starts successfully
3. AFTER cleanup THEN the system SHALL run existing tests to ensure functionality is preserved
4. WHEN issues arise THEN the system SHALL have a rollback plan to restore removed files if needed
