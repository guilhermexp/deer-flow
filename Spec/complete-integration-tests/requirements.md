# Requirements: Complete Integration Tests - Neon + Clerk

## 1. Overview
**Goal**: Execute comprehensive integration tests to validate that the application works correctly with Neon PostgreSQL and Clerk Authentication after Supabase cleanup
**User Problem**: Need to ensure all core functionality works properly after migration

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Database Tests
- [ ] **FR-1**: Verify Neon PostgreSQL connection is working
- [ ] **FR-2**: Test database schema is correct and tables exist
- [ ] **FR-3**: Test basic CRUD operations on database

### 2.2 Authentication Tests
- [ ] **FR-4**: Verify Clerk authentication is properly configured
- [ ] **FR-5**: Test user login/logout flows
- [ ] **FR-6**: Test session management and token refresh

### 2.3 Application Feature Tests
- [ ] **FR-7**: Test project creation functionality
- [ ] **FR-8**: Test note creation and insertion
- [ ] **FR-9**: Test note retrieval and display
- [ ] **FR-10**: Test data persistence across sessions

### 2.4 API Integration Tests
- [ ] **FR-11**: Test backend API endpoints
- [ ] **FR-12**: Test frontend API client integration
- [ ] **FR-13**: Test error handling and edge cases

### 2.5 DevTools Tests
- [ ] **FR-14**: Run TypeScript type checking
- [ ] **FR-15**: Run linting checks
- [ ] **FR-16**: Run unit tests
- [ ] **FR-17**: Run build validation

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- All tests should complete within reasonable timeframes
- Database queries should be performant
- No memory leaks or resource issues

### 3.2 Constraints
- Tests must not modify production data
- Must use test/development environment
- Must validate against Neon PostgreSQL

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given database connection, when tested, then connection succeeds
- [ ] Given project creation request, when executed, then project is created in database
- [ ] Given note insertion request, when executed, then note is stored and retrievable
- [ ] Given user authentication, when tested, then user can login/logout successfully
- [ ] Given all tests, when executed, then all pass without errors
- [ ] Given application startup, when tested, then all services are healthy

## 5. Out of Scope
- Performance optimization
- Load testing
- Security penetration testing
