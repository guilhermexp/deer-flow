# Requirements: Test Orchestration Tools

## 1. Overview
**Goal**: Verify that all orchestration delegation and task management tools are functioning correctly
**User Problem**: Need to ensure the spec workflow system can create, manage, and delegate tasks properly

## 2. Functional Requirements
### 2.1 Core Features
- [ ] **FR-1**: Orchestrator can create and manage feature specifications
- [ ] **FR-2**: Task upsert functionality works correctly
- [ ] **FR-3**: Task delegation to agents functions properly
- [ ] **FR-4**: Document creation and approval workflow operates

### 2.2 User Stories
As a spec manager, I want to create and manage specifications so that I can coordinate development workflows
As a spec manager, I want to delegate tasks to agents so that I can execute development work efficiently

## 3. Technical Requirements
### 3.1 Performance
- Task creation: < 2 seconds
- Delegation response: < 5 seconds
- Document operations: < 1 second

### 3.2 Constraints
- Must maintain task dependencies
- Must track task status accurately
- Must support agent selection

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Given a new feature is set, when creating requirements document, then system SHALL create the document successfully
- [ ] Given a task is created, when upserting task information, then system SHALL store the task correctly
- [ ] Given a task exists, when delegating to an agent, then system SHALL initiate delegation properly
- [ ] Given documents are created, when requesting approval, then system SHALL record approval status

## 5. Out of Scope
- Actual code execution by agents
- Real development workflows
- Production task management
