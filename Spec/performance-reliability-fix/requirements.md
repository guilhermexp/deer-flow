# Requirements: Performance & Reliability Fix

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical performance and reliability issues identified in the application, including excessive API calls, resource preloading problems, backend service failures, and authentication issues. The goal is to optimize frontend performance, fix backend connectivity, and ensure reliable service operation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Calendar Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the calendar to load quickly without excessive API calls, so that I can efficiently view and navigate my schedule.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the calendar component mounts THEN the system SHALL implement caching to prevent repeated API calls for the same date range
2. WHEN users navigate between dates THEN the system SHALL use debounced API calls with a minimum 300ms delay
3. WHEN loading calendar events THEN the system SHALL batch API requests by date ranges rather than individual dates
4. IF no events exist for a date range THEN the system SHALL cache this result to prevent repeated empty requests
5. WHEN the calendar is unmounted THEN the system SHALL clean up any pending requests and caches

### Requirement 2: Resource Preloading Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to load efficiently without wasting resources on unused preloads, so that the application starts quickly and uses bandwidth effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN resources are preloaded THEN the system SHALL use appropriate `as` attribute values matching the resource type
2. IF a preloaded resource is not used within 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL log a warning and consider removing the preload
3. WHEN critical CSS and JavaScript files are preloaded THEN the system SHALL ensure they are actually used during page load
4. WHEN non-critical resources are preloaded THEN the system SHALL use `lazy` loading or defer their loading
5. IF resource preloading causes browser warnings THEN the system SHALL remove or correct the problematic preload directives

### Requirement 3: Backend Service Reliability

**User Story:** As a user, I want all API endpoints to respond reliably, so that I can use all application features without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API endpoints return 503 Service Unavailable THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff (max 3 attempts)
2. WHEN API endpoints return 502 Bad Gateway THEN the system SHALL implement circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
3. IF backend services are unavailable THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages with suggested actions
4. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging
5. WHEN services recover THEN the system SHALL automatically resume normal operation without user intervention

### Requirement 4: Authentication System Fix

**User Story:** As a user, I want to authenticate seamlessly without encountering authorization errors, so that I can access protected features reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL validate them properly and handle errors gracefully
2. IF authentication fails with 401 Unauthorized THEN the system SHALL prompt users to re-enter credentials or refresh tokens
3. WHEN authentication tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh them if possible
4. WHEN multiple API calls require authentication THEN the system SHALL reuse valid tokens to prevent repeated authentication requests
5. IF authentication service is misconfigured THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to administrators

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear feedback when errors occur, so that I understand what happened and how to proceed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages instead of technical details
2. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system shall show appropriate offline indicators
3. IF retry operations are available THEN the system SHALL provide retry buttons with clear labels
4. WHEN partial functionality is available during outages THEN the system shall enable those features while disabling affected ones
5. WHEN errors are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh the relevant UI components

### Requirement 6: Performance Monitoring

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to monitor application performance and reliability, so that I can proactively identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log response times and success rates
2. WHEN performance thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL alert administrators
3. IF resource preloading is ineffective THEN the system SHALL report this in performance metrics
4. WHEN authentication failures occur THEN the system SHALL track failure patterns and frequencies
5. WHEN backend services degrade THEN the system SHALL provide detailed performance diagnostics

## Out of Scope

- Complete redesign of the UI/UX (focus on performance and reliability only)
- Addition of new features beyond fixing existing functionality
- Database schema changes unless required for performance optimization
- Migration to different backend technologies
